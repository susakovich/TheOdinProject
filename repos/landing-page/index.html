            One of the best things about cats is that they are very independent
            creatures. Unlike dogs, who require quite a high level of attention
            each day, cats are quite happy to have time to themselves. In fact,
            cats will sleep for about 15 hours a day so you don't have to worry
            about them being too bored when you're at work. <br />

          <p class="about__content-text">
            If you thought cats spent a lot of their lives sleeping, you’d be
            right. According to Veterinary Hub, Cats actually spend 70% of their
            lives sleeping, which works out to around 13-16 hours a day. It’s a
            cat’s life!

          <h4>The record for the longest cat ever is 123 cm's</h4>
          <p class="about__content-text">
            Domestic cats are usually considered to be quite small and dainty
            creatures. But did you know the world’s longest cat was a Maine Coon
            called Stewie, and was measured at 123 cm's? Whereas, the record for
            the tallest cat belonged to Arcturus at a whopping 19.05 inches
            tall! Those are some big cats.

          <h4>House cats share 95.6% of their genetic makeup with tigers</h4>
          <p class="about__content-text">
            This cat fact will really blow your mind. A study discovered that
            our little house cats share 95.6% of their genetic makeup with
            tigers! They also share a lot of the same behaviours such as scent
            and urine marking, prey stalking and pouncing.

          <h4>The record for the loudest purr is 67.8db</h4>
          <p class="about__content-text">
            The record for the loudest purr by a domestic cat is currently held
            by Merlin, a black and white cat from Torquay, UK. His purr is
            67.8db and for context, this is nearly the same volume as a shower!
            Most cats purr at around 25db.
