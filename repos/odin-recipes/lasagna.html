    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place ground beef in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat
        until evenly browned. Drain, then season with taco seasoning, garlic,
        chili powder, and cayenne pepper. Pour in water. Simmer for 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease the
        bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place 6 tortillas into the prepared baking dish. Spread 1/3 of the salsa
        on top of the tortillas. Spread 1/2 of the meat mixture evenly over the
        salsa. Sprinkle with 1/2 of the green onions. Drop 1/2 of the sour cream
        randomly over the green onions. Top with 1/2 cup Cheddar and 1/2 cup
        Monterey Jack cheese. Repeat layers. Top with 6 tortillas, spread with
        remaining salsa, and sprinkle with remaining cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 45 minutes or until cheeses are
        melted.
